    <h1>M People</h1>

  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">M People is a British dance music band formed in 1990 in Manchester. The group was founded by DJ and musician Mike Pickering, formerly of Factory Records, alongside keyboardist Paul Heard and percussionist Shovell. The distinctive voice of Heather Small became the hallmark of the band, contributing significantly to their signature sound.

M People derives its name from the initial of founding member Mike Pickering's first name. The band achieved significant success in the 1990s, becoming known for their uplifting, soulful dance tracks. They rose to prominence with their debut album, &quot;Northern Soul&quot; (1991), but it was their sophomore release, &quot;Elegant Slumming&quot; (1993), that catapulted them into the mainstream, earning a Mercury Music Prize and spawning hits like &quot;Moving on Up&quot; and &quot;One Night in Heaven.&quot;

Their subsequent albums, &quot;Bizarre Fruit&quot; (1994) and &quot;Fresco&quot; (1997), continued their success, producing well-loved tracks such as &quot;Sight for Sore Eyes&quot; and &quot;Search for the Hero.&quot; Known for combining elements of house music with funk and soul, M People left an indelible mark on the UK music scene before going on an extended hiatus in the late 1990s. They have since reunited for occasional performances, celebrating their legacy as pioneers of 90s dance music.</p>
