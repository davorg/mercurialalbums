  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">Everything Is Recorded is the collaborative musical project of British record producer Richard Russell. Known primarily as the head of the iconic record label XL Recordings, Russell launched Everything Is Recorded in 2017 as a platform to bring together a diverse array of musicians and vocalists. The project's music is an eclectic mix encompassing genres such as electronic, soul, R&amp;B, and hip-hop.

Everything Is Recorded gained significant attention with the release of its debut self-titled EP in 2017, followed by the full-length album &quot;Everything Is Recorded by Richard Russell&quot; in 2018. The album featured an impressive roster of collaborators, including artists like Sampha, Ibeyi, and Peter Gabriel, highlighting Russell's ability to blend different sonic influences into a cohesive sound.

Celebrated for its innovative approach to production and collaboration, the project has been praised for its deep emotional resonance and rich sonic textures. Everything Is Recorded continues to be a testament to Russell's creative vision and his dedication to pushing the boundaries of contemporary music through collaborative artistry.</p>
