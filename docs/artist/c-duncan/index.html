    <h1>C Duncan</h1>

  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">C Duncan, born Christopher Duncan on July 29, 1989, in Glasgow, Scotland, is a Scottish musician and composer known for his distinctive blend of classical and contemporary sounds. Raised in a musically inclined family, he was exposed to a rich tapestry of influences from a young age. His mother was a viola player and his father a composer, which helped nurture his musical talents. Duncan studied at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where he honed his skills in classical composition.

In 2015, Duncan released his debut album &quot;Architect,&quot; which garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize. His music is characterized by lush, multi-layered harmonies and intricate arrangements, often drawing comparisons to artists like Fleet Foxes and Sufjan Stevens. Duncan followed up with &quot;The Midnight Sun&quot; in 2016, further establishing his reputation for crafting atmospheric and introspective soundscapes. His third album, &quot;Health,&quot; released in 2019, marked a shift towards a more polished pop sound, drawing on personal experiences and collaborations. Duncan's work is celebrated for its melodic richness and emotional depth, securing his place as a distinctive voice in modern music.</p>
