    <h1>Robbie Williams</h1>

  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">Robbie Williams, born on February 13, 1974, in Stoke-on-Trent, England, is a renowned British singer-songwriter and entertainer. He rose to fame as a member of the popular boy band Take That in the early 1990s. During his time with the group, they achieved widespread success with hits like &quot;Back for Good&quot; and &quot;Pray,&quot; making them one of the biggest acts in the UK and Europe.

In 1995, Williams left Take That to embark on a solo career, a move that proved to be highly successful. His debut solo album, &quot;Life Thru a Lens&quot; (1997), included the hit single &quot;Angels,&quot; which became one of his signature songs and established him as a prominent solo artist. Over the years, Williams released several successful albums, including &quot;I've Been Expecting You&quot; (1998), &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot; (2000), and &quot;Escapology&quot; (2002). Known for his charismatic stage presence and distinctive voice, he has sold millions of records worldwide, earning numerous awards, including multiple BRIT Awards.

Beyond music, Williams is also known for his engaging personality and forays into television, including appearances as a judge on &quot;The X Factor UK.&quot; He remains an influential figure in pop music, celebrated for his contributions to the British music scene.</p>
