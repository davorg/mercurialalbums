  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">Novelist, born Kwadwo Quentin Kankam on January 20, 1997, is a British grime artist renowned for his contributions to the UK music scene. Raised in Lewisham, South London, Novelist began his musical journey at a young age, quickly drawing attention with his distinctive style and formidable lyrical prowess. He emerged as a significant figure in the grime genre during the early 2010s, gaining recognition as part of the collective The Square.

Novelist's breakout moment came with the release of singles like &quot;Take Time&quot; in 2014, a collaboration with fellow producer Mumdance, which showcased his ability to blend traditional grime elements with innovative sounds.
