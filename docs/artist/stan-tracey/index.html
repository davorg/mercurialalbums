    <h1>Stan Tracey</h1>

  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">Stan Tracey was a renowned British jazz pianist and composer, celebrated for his innovative contributions to the jazz genre. Born on December 30, 1926, in London, Tracey began his musical journey as an accordionist before transitioning to piano. His career took off in the 1950s when he became the pianist for the Vic Ash-Harry Klein Quartet.

Tracey's style was heavily influenced by Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and the bebop movement, contributing to his distinctive approach. From 1960 to 1967, he served as the house pianist at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, a pivotal period during which he accompanied numerous American jazz legends, including Stan Getz and Sonny Rollins.

His acclaimed album, &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1965), inspired by Dylan Thomas's radio play, is considered one of the great achievements of British jazz and exemplifies his innovative blending of narrative and music. Tracey continued to experiment with composition and performance throughout his career, earning an OBE in 1986 and later a CBE in 2008 for his services to jazz. His legacy endures through his recordings and influence on subsequent generations of musicians. Stan Tracey passed away on December 6, 2013, leaving behind a rich musical heritage.</p>
