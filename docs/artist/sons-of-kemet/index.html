    <h1>Sons of Kemet</h1>

  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">Sons of Kemet is a dynamic British jazz group formed in 2011, known for their innovative fusion of jazz, Caribbean rhythms, Afrobeat, and more. The band was originally conceived by saxophonist and composer Shabaka Hutchings, a prominent figure in the contemporary London jazz scene. The distinctive lineup of Sons of Kemet includes a tuba, played by Theon Cross, and two drummers, Seb Rochford and Tom Skinner, who were later succeeded by Eddie Hick and others over time.

The band quickly gained attention for their energetic live performances and unique sound, characterized by Hutchings’ powerful saxophone lines intertwined with pulsating rhythms and deep bass from the tuba. Sons of Kemet released their debut album, *Burn*, in 2013 to critical acclaim. Their subsequent albums, including *Lest We Forget What We Came Here to Do* (2015) and *Your Queen is a Reptile* (2018), further established their reputation, with the latter earning a Mercury Prize nomination.

In 2021, the group released *Black to the Future*, an album reflecting on contemporary social and political issues through a musical lens. Sons of Kemet continues to be celebrated for pushing the boundaries of jazz and engaging with themes of identity, history, and revolution.</p>
