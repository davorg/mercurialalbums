    <h1>Cornershop</h1>

  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">Cornershop is a British band formed in 1991 by Tjinder Singh and Ben Ayres in Leicester, England. Known for their eclectic sound, they blend elements of indie rock, electronic music, and traditional Indian music. The band initially gained attention in the Britpop scene of the 1990s, standing out with their distinctive style that melded Western and Eastern musical influences.

Their breakthrough came with the 1997 album &quot;When I Was Born for the 7th Time,&quot; which featured the hit single &quot;Brimful of Asha.&quot; The song, an infectious tribute to Indian playback singer Asha Bhosle and the joy of music, received widespread acclaim and found further success through a remix by Norman Cook, also known as Fatboy Slim.

Over the years, Cornershop has continued to release music that defies easy categorization, maintaining a reputation for innovation and cultural commentary. Their work often reflects Tjinder Singh's Indian heritage and addresses themes of identity and multiculturalism. With their unique approach and enduring creativity, Cornershop remains a notable and influential presence in the landscape of contemporary music.</p>
