  <section class="artist-blurb">
    <p class="blurb-text">Disclosure is an English electronic music duo composed of brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence. Originating from Reigate, Surrey, they emerged in the early 2010s as a fresh voice in the house and garage music scene. They gained prominence with their breakout single, &quot;Latch,&quot; featuring Sam Smith, released in 2012. This track became a defining moment in their career, showcasing their knack for blending soulful vocals with infectious dance rhythms.

Their debut album, &quot;Settle,&quot; released in 2013, received critical acclaim and commercial success, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Dance/Electronica Album. Known for their dynamic live performances, Disclosure expanded their appeal by collaborating with a range of artists, including Lorde, The Weeknd, and Khalid.

In 2015, Disclosure released their second album, &quot;Caracal,&quot; which continued their exploration of sophisticated electronic sounds and was also nominated for a Grammy. Their third album, &quot;Energy,&quot; came out in 2020, featuring a mix of established and rising artists, demonstrating their ability to innovate and adapt. With their impact on modern electronic music, Disclosure remains influential, continually pushing the boundaries of the genre.</p>
